The following cities need to be edited manually:
Brest (FR). The teleporter sends it to Brest (BY).
Bordeaux (FR). The teleporter goes to Bor (CZ), cannot find it and chooses Bordeaux.
San Sebastian/Donestia (ES). For some reason, it chooses Douglas over San Sebastian/Donestia.
Haparanda (S). It also has Aranda de Duero as a value.
Turku (FI). It also has Ulm.
Timisoara (RO). It is missing.
All countries from Going East are missing too (Whoops, my bad)
